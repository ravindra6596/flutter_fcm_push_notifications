      "text": "1.1 Dhritarashtra said  What did my people and the sons of Pandu do when they had assembled\\ntogether eager for battle on the holy plain of Kurukshetra, O Sanjaya.",
      "meaning": "Dhritarashtra said: \"O Sanjaya, assembled on the holy field of Kurukshetra, eager for battle, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?\"",
      "explanation": "In the first verse of the Bhagavad Gita, the blind king Dhritarashtra asks his charioteer Sanjaya what his sons (the Kauravas) and the sons of Pandu (the Pandavas) did on the holy land of Kurukshetra, where they had gathered to fight. Dhritarashtra feared that the influence of the holy land might favor the righteous Pandavas, and his question reveals his attachment and bias. This inquiry marks the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita's discourse, in which Sanjaya narrates the events on the battlefield."

      "meaning": "Sanjaya said: \"O King (Dhritarashtra), upon seeing the Pandava army, which was arranged in military formation, King Duryodhana then approached his teacher, Dronacharya, and spoke these words.\"",
      "explanation": "After Dhritarashtra's question in the first verse, Sanjaya begins his response in the second verse.

This verse highlights Duryodhana's underlying anxiety and fear upon seeing the Pandava army."
